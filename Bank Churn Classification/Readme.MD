# ðŸ’³ Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn using a bank dataset. It involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Classification (to predict churn)


ðŸ“Š **Goals**
- Understand key factors influencing customer churn
- Build a predictive model using classification algorithms

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Œ **Key ML Techniques**
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- Label Encoding, Train-Test Split, Accuracy/Recall/F1 Score

ðŸ§  **Insights**
- Which features affect churn the most?
- Which customers are likely to leave?
