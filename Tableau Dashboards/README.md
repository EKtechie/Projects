**Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau**

**Tools:** Tableau, Excel

**Skills:** Data Visualization, User Engagement Analysis, Dashboard Design, Data-Driven Strategy

**Description:**

Created an interactive Tableau dashboard as part of the 365 Data Science program, focused on analyzing user engagement with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed feature using real-world data from January to May 2023.

**Key achievements:**

Explored over 50,000 data points to assess post frequency, subtype distribution, average likes, and comment patterns.

Found that manual text posts, while fewer in number, had the highest comment engagement—indicating strong user interest and interaction.

Highlighted that automated posts like certificates and levels contributed the most to post volume but had lower engagement per post.

Delivered insights into optimal content types, helping guide improvements to the newsfeed feature for better engagement.

**Outcome:**

The project provided actionable recommendations for enhancing the newsfeed’s relevance and interactivity—encouraging more user-generated content and supporting platform engagement, subscriptions, and community growth.
