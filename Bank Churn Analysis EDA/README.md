# 🏦 Bank Churn Analysis – Data Preparation & EDA

This project focuses on preparing and exploring a bank customer churn dataset to identify key factors contributing to customer churn. 
It serves as a foundational step toward building predictive models for churn classification.

> 🧭 **This project is guided by [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/), as part of a structured learning path in data analytics and business intelligence.**


## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand the relationship between key features and customer churn
- Identify potential features for modeling


## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Seaborn** – for advanced visualizations
- **Matplotlib** – for standard plots
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for exploratory analysis

## 📊 Key EDA Insights

- Visualized churn distribution across features like:
  - Credit Score
  - Tenure
  - Balance
  - Geography
  - Gender
- Identified patterns and correlations to guide feature selection for modeling
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data types


## 📂 Dataset

> The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
- Customer ID
- Credit Score
- Gender
- Geography
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- IsActiveMember
- EstimatedSalary
- Exited (Churn flag)


## 🚀 Next Steps

- Feature engineering for machine learning
- Model building (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
- Model evaluation and tuning
