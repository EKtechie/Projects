🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone (Coursera), where the objective is to predict the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage boosters. Predicting booster landings is important because it directly impacts launch costs—boosters that land successfully can be reused, significantly reducing expenses.

📌 Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space travel with reusable rockets. In this project, we:

Collected and analyzed data on Falcon 9 launches.

Built interactive visualizations and dashboards.

Developed predictive models to determine the likelihood of a booster successfully landing.
